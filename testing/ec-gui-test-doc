Testing plan for the Search Page portion of the GUI
Created 2/18/2020 by Ern Chi Khoo

- starting the application should create a new window that has:
	- the title of the site on the very top of the page
	- several search queries that are:
		- a text box if the user can enter a search query
		- a drop down menu if the user can pick from given options 
	- the extra functionality are implemented through:
		- a checkbox that allows users to sort each individual results page alphabetically
		- a textbox that allows users to enter a due date for each job post
		- a drop down menu for the user to pick the type of salary they want for the job post
	- a search button at the bottom of the page

- the user can:
	- enter any query or search input for any queries in the search page
	- clicking the search button will:
		- open a new window where the results will be displayed 
	
- to test the page:
	- the program was executed to ensure that: 
		- all the search queries that were parsed from the search page were generated 
		- all the options from extra functionality were generated
	- each drop down menu was selected to ensure all options were listed in the menu
	- each text box query was tested by entering a search query
